    "description": "The Chloris Global Biomass 2003 - 2019 dataset provides estimates of stock and change in aboveground biomass for Earth's terrestrial woody vegetation ecosystems. It covers the period 2003 - 2019, at annual time steps. The global dataset has a circa 4.6 km spatial resolution.\n\nThe maps and data sets were generated by combining multiple remote sensing measurements from space borne satellites, processed using state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical methods, validated with field data from multiple countries. The dataset provides direct estimates of aboveground stock and change, and are not based on land use or land cover area change, and as such they include gains and losses of carbon stock in all types of woody vegetation - whether natural or plantations.\n\nAnnual stocks are expressed in units of tons of biomass. Annual changes in stocks are expressed in units of CO2 equivalent, i.e., the amount of CO2 released from or taken up by terrestrial ecosystems for that specific pixel.\n\nThe spatial data sets are available on [Microsoftâ€™s Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/chloris-biomass) under a Creative Common license of the type Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike [CC BY-NC-SA](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0.html).\n\n[Chloris Geospatial](https://chloris.earth/) is a mission-driven technology company that develops software and data products on the state of natural capital for use by business, governments, and the social sector.\n",
